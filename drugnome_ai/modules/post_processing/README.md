- Aggregate results from all classifiers to extract consensus of predictions (with different flexibility criteria, such as min. number of classifiers prediciting a gene as positive, etc.)
- Overlap consensus of positive predictions with 2-D projections of the original gene space (with PCA, t-SNE and UMAP).
